# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network (RNN) performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project implements Sentiment Analysis (Binary Classification problem) using Word Embedding layer, LSTM layer, Dense layer and sigmoid function.
